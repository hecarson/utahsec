# UtahSec CTF writeup repository

Welcome to the UtahSec CTF writeup repository!

## What is a CTF writeup?

A writeup for a CTF challenge is a document explaining how someone solved the challenge, and is usually written by a CTF player (such as you!) who solves a challenge. A writeup often includes:

* Brief background information about the challenge,
* Information that the player gathered during analysis,
* Steps taken for the solution,
* Solver/exploit scripts that the player used, and
* The final flag that the player found.

## Why write CTF writeups?

Writing CTF writeups benefits yourself and others. It benefits yourself because, as the adage goes, "the best way to learn is to teach", and it is a great way to reinforce the skills and knowledge that you've learned from a challenge. Additionally, it is a great way to document the skills you've learned over your cybersecurity journey.

Writeups benefit others because reading writeups is one of the best ways to learn the technical cybersecurity skills needed to fully solve a challenge on your own. If you have ever learned something new from reading someone else's writeup, it is good to give back to your community of fellow hackers and contribute to a culture of sharing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic).

## How can I add my own writeup to this repo?

Feel free to use the [CTF writeup template](ctf-writeup-template.md) to get started. You can also look at the existing writeups for examples. After you have finished your writeup, please make a GitHub pull request with your writeup and relevant files in the appropriate directory (`<CTF event name>/<challenge name>/README.md` for the writeup) and notify a UtahSec officer in the Discord server.
